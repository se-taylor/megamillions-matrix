## Overview

The Mega Millions Matrix - a product of my obsession with numbers.

The Mega Millions Matrix website automatically updates the Winning Numbers within a few hours after the drawings are made, twice a week.

Only results since October 31, 2017 are displayed, which is the date that Mega Millions changed their game matrix to 5/70 / 1/25.

## Browser Support

At present, I officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 9+

This is not to say that The Mega Millions Matrix cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that my focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## Inspiration

Mega Millions, my obsession with numbers and my laziness to maintain spreadsheets.
