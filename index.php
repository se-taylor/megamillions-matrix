                <h4>How was Mega Millions created?</h4>
                The history of Mega Millions® is as exciting as playing the game! Following a record $363 million Big Game jackpot in 2000, interest in multi-state games was at an all-time high. And as interest in the multi-state games grew, so did the participants. In May 2002, New York and Ohio joined Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia to create Mega Millions!
                <br /><br />
                Sales for the country's newest multi-state jackpot game began on May 15, 2002, and the first drawing was May 17, 2002.
                <br /><br />
                It didn't take long for players in other states to join the mega fun! By September 2002, Washington had joined Mega Millions and in December 2003, Texas began offering the game to its players. In June 2005, California became the 12th member, solidifying Mega Millions as the country's most widely played multi-state jackpot game.
                <br /><br />
                On January 31, 2010, 23 more state lotteries joined Mega Millions as an historic cross-selling agreement between Mega Millions and Powerball went into effect.
                <br /><br />
                Today, all American lotteries participate in Mega Millions, including the Virgin Islands Lottery.

                <h4>Mega Millions Trivia</h4>
                There was a jackpot winner in the very first Mega Millions® drawing. The drawing on May 17, 2002 resulted in a $28 million winning ticket in Illinois. There was a second jackpot winner just one week later - which means there were two jackpot winners within the first three Mega Millions drawings.
                <br /><br />
                Mega Millions has awarded 24 jackpots of more than $300 million, including the Mega Millions record of $1.537 billion won in South Carolina on October 23, 2018.
                <br /><br />
                The largest Mega Millions jackpot won on a single ticket is that $1.537 billion prize, which is also the world’s largest lottery prize won on a single ticket. Other large single prizes have been $1.050 billion won in Michigan on January 22, 2021;  $543 million won in California on July 24, 2018; $536 million won in Indiana on July 8, 2016; and $533 million won in New Jersey on March 30, 2018.
                <br /><br />
                Six Mega Millions jackpots have been won on a Friday the 13th. Michigan has been especially lucky on that special day, with four winning jackpots (June 2008, May 2011, June 2014, and one shared with Rhode Island in October 2017). A Friday the 13th jackpot was also won in New York in March 2009 and in Ohio in November 2015.

              The Mega Millions spider collects the winning numbers from the interwebs, then updates this site automatically within a few hours after the drawings are made, twice a week.
