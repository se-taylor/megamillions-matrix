                There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul.

                Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more?
                <br><br>
                When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?

                <h4>What is Mega Millions?</h4>
                Mega Millions (originally known as The Big Game in 1996 and renamed, temporarily, to The Big Game Mega Millions six years later) is an American multi-jurisdictional lottery game; offered in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
                <br /><br />
                Mega Millions is drawn at 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday and Friday evenings, including holidays. Mega Millions is administered by a consortium of its 12 original lotteries; the drawings are held at the studios of WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, supervised by the Georgia Lottery.
                <br /><br />
                Under the current version's regulations (which began October 28, 2017 with the first drawing October 31) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised jackpot is $40 million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing 5% each year (unless the cash option is chosen.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner.
                <br /><br />
                The current version of Mega Millions requires players to match 5 of 70 white balls, and the gold-colored "MegaBall" from a second field, of 25 numbers (5/70 / 1/25).

                <h4>$1.537 Billion : The Largest Mega Millions Jackpot!</h4>
                On October 23, 2018, Mega Millions again set an industry milestone with a $1.537 billion jackpot; it was only the second time ever that any lottery prize passed the billion dollar mark. Because there was just one winning ticket in the drawing, sold in South Carolina, it was the world's largest lottery prize ever won on a single ticket.

                <h4>Mega Millions Trivia</h4>
                There was a jackpot winner in the very first Mega Millions® drawing. The drawing on May 17, 2002 resulted in a $28 million winning ticket in Illinois. There was a second jackpot winner just one week later - which means there were two jackpot winners within the first three Mega Millions drawings.
                <br /><br />
                Mega Millions has awarded 24 jackpots of more than $300 million, including the Mega Millions record of $1.537 billion won in South Carolina on October 23, 2018.
                <br /><br />
                The largest Mega Millions jackpot won on a single ticket is that $1.537 billion prize, which is also the world’s largest lottery prize won on a single ticket. Other large single prizes have been $1.050 billion won in Michigan on January 22, 2021;  $543 million won in California on July 24, 2018; $536 million won in Indiana on July 8, 2016; and $533 million won in New Jersey on March 30, 2018.
                <br /><br />
                Six Mega Millions jackpots have been won on a Friday the 13th. Michigan has been especially lucky on that special day, with four winning jackpots (June 2008, May 2011, June 2014, and one shared with Rhode Island in October 2017). A Friday the 13th jackpot was also won in New York in March 2009 and in Ohio in November 2015.
